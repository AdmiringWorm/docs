<Callout type="info" title="Chocolatey Baseline">
Chocolatey provides a suggested installation and configuration script along with the rest of the organizational guide. It's available [in the choco-orgguide-scripts repository](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco-orgguide-scripts/blob/main/ClientSetup.ps1).
</Callout>

### Usage

You can download and run the script in one of two ways - fill out the values below, and select the tab closest to your environment:

| Variable | Value | Usage |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Chocolatey Core Repository URL | <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="OrgGuideCoreRepositoryUrl" defaultValue="NexusChocolateyCoreRepository" /> | Used as the distribution point for approved packages. |
| Repository User Name | <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="OrgGuideRepoUserName" defaultValue="chocouser" /> | Used to authenticate to and manage Chocolatey Packages on the repository. |
| Repository User Password | <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="OrgGuideRepoUserPassword" defaultValue="ChocoUserPassword" /> | Used to authenticate to and manage Chocolatey Packages on the repository. |
| Chocolatey Central Management URL | <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="OrgGuideCcmUrl" defaultValue="https://ccm.example.org:24020/ChocolateyManagementService" /> | Used to communicate with the Chocolatey Central Management service. |
| Chocolatey Central Management Service Salt | <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="OrgGuideCcmServiceSalt" defaultValue="ServiceCommunicationSalt" /> | Used to secure communication to the Chocolatey Central Management service. |
| Chocolatey Central Management Client Salt | <DynamicCodeBlockInput name="OrgGuideCcmClientSalt" defaultValue="ClientCommunicationSalt" /> | Used to secure communication to the Chocolatey Central Management service. |


export const clientsetupscenarios = [
    { id: 'repo,ccm', title: 'Repository and CCM', isActive: true },
    { id: 'repo', title: 'Repository Only' },
    { id: 'ccm', title: 'CCM Only' },
    { id: 'none', title: 'No Servers' },
];

<TabsTabContainer content={clientsetupscenarios} />
<TabsPaneContainer>
    <TabsPane content={clientsetupscenarios[0]}>
        If your environment has a deployed repository solution that we have created, you will have a copy of the script present in a binary repository.

        To download and install it, run PowerShell as shown below:

<DynamicCodeBlock language="powershell">
{`
$ScriptArgs = @{
    RepositoryUrl = "OrgGuideCoreRepositoryUrl"
    RepositoryCredential = [PSCredential]::new(
        "OrgGuideRepoUserName",
        (ConvertTo-SecureString "OrgGuideRepoUserPassword" -AsPlainText -Force)
    )
    ChocolateyCentralManagementUrl = "OrgGuideCcmUrl"
    ServiceCommunicationSalt = "OrgGuideCcmServiceSalt"
    ClientCommunicationSalt = "OrgGuideCcmClientSalt"
}
$WebClient = [System.Net.WebClient]::new()
$WebClient.Credentials = $ScriptArgs.RepositoryCredential
& ([scriptblock]::Create($WebClient.DownloadString(
    ($ScriptArgs.RepositoryUrl -replace '\/repository\/(?<RepositoryName>.+)\/(index.json)?$', '/repository/choco-install/ClientSetup.ps1')
))) @ScriptArgs
`}
</DynamicCodeBlock>

        This should result in a configured client with:
        - Chocolatey CLI installed and configured for business usage.
            - Your Production and Core sources configured for use.
            - A selection of Chocolatey recommended features and configurations.
        - Chocolatey Agent installed and configured for background service.
        - Chocolatey Central Management reporting and deployments enabled.
    </TabsPane>
    <TabsPane content={clientsetupscenarios[1]}>
        If your environment has a deployed repository solution that we have created, you will have a copy of the script present in a binary repository.

        To download and install it, run PowerShell as shown below:

<DynamicCodeBlock language="powershell">
{`
$ScriptArgs = @{
    RepositoryUrl = "OrgGuideProductionRepositoryUrl"
    RepositoryCredential = [PSCredential]::new(
        "OrgGuideRepoUserName",
        (ConvertTo-SecureString "OrgGuideRepoUserPassword" -AsPlainText -Force)
    )
    ChocolateyCentralManagementUrl = "OrgGuideCcmUrl"
    ClientCommunicationSalt = "OrgGuideCcmClientSalt"
    ServiceCommunicationSalt = "OrgGuideCcmServiceSalt"
}
$WebClient = [System.Net.WebClient]::new()
$WebClient.Credentials = $ScriptArgs.RepositoryCredential
& [scriptblock]::Create($WebClient.DownloadString(
    ($ScriptArgs.RepositoryUrl -replace '\/repository\/(?<RepositoryName>.+)\/(index.json)?$', '/repository/choco-install/ChocolateyInstall.ps1')
)) @ScriptArgs
`}
</DynamicCodeBlock>

        This should result in a configured client with:
        - Chocolatey CLI installed and configured for business usage.
            - Your Production and Core sources configured for use.
            - A selection of Chocolatey recommended features and configurations.
        - Chocolatey Agent installed and configured for background service.
        - Chocolatey Central Management reporting and deployments enabled.
    </TabsPane>
    <TabsPane content={clientsetupscenarios[2]}>
        As you do not have a repository set up internally, you will need to download the script at runtime or host it internally and reference it.

        To download and install it, run PowerShell as shown below:

<DynamicCodeBlock language="powershell">
{`
$ScriptArgs = @{
    ChocolateyCentralManagementUrl = "OrgGuideCcmUrl"
    ClientCommunicationSalt = "OrgGuideCcmClientSalt"
    ServiceCommunicationSalt = "OrgGuideCcmServiceSalt"
}
& [scriptblock]::Create([System.Net.WebClient]::new().DownloadString(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocolatey/choco-orgguide-scripts/refs/heads/main/ClientSetup.ps1"
)) @ScriptArgs
`}
</DynamicCodeBlock>

        This should result in a configured client with:
        - Chocolatey CLI installed and configured for business usage.
            - A selection of Chocolatey recommended features and configurations.
        - Chocolatey Agent installed and configured for background service.
        - Chocolatey Central Management reporting and deployments enabled.
    </TabsPane>
    <TabsPane content={clientsetupscenarios[3]}>
        As you do not have a repository set up internally, you will need to download the script at runtime or host it internally and reference it.

        To download and install it, run PowerShell as shown below:

<DynamicCodeBlock language="powershell">
{`
& [scriptblock]::Create([System.Net.WebClient]::new().DownloadString(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocolatey/choco-orgguide-scripts/refs/heads/main/ClientSetup.ps1"
)) -LicensePath ~\Downloads\chocolatey.license.xml
`}
</DynamicCodeBlock>

        NOTE: You will need to update the path to a valid Chocolatey For Business license file.

        This should result in a configured client with:
        - Chocolatey CLI installed and configured for business usage.
            - A selection of Chocolatey recommended features and configurations.
        - Chocolatey Agent installed and configured for background service.
    </TabsPane>
</TabsPaneContainer>

You can also save the script to your client machine and run it with the same parameters, as above:

<DynamicCodeBlock language="powershell">
{`
.\ClientSetup.ps1 @ScriptArgs
`}
</DynamicCodeBlock>

### Setup Modification

You can additionally use this script to add configuration, packages, and more.

By passing arguments to `AdditionalConfiguration`, `AdditionalFeatures`, `AdditionalSources`, and `AdditionalPackages` you can additively configure your Chocolatey client - or you can add lines directly to the Client Setup script and deploy that.

#### Configuration

You can adjust any Chocolatey configuration value by adding an `-AdditionalConfiguration` argument to your Client Setup script invocation.

```powershell
.\ClientSetup.ps1 @ScriptArgs -AdditionalConfiguration @{
    BackgroundServiceAllowedCommands = 'install,upgrade,uninstall'
    commandExecutionTimeoutSeconds = 6000
}
```

This can override the base configuration we provide in the client setup.

#### Features

You can adjust any Chocolatey feature by adding an `-AdditionalFeatures` argument to your Client Setup script invocation.

```powershell
.\ClientSetup.ps1 @ScriptArgs -AdditionalFeatures @{
    useBackgroundservice = 'Enabled'
}
```

This can override the base features we provide in the client setup.

#### Sources

You can add any additional sources you desire by adding the `-AdditionalSources` argument to your Client Setup script invocation.

```powershell
.\ClientSetup.ps1 @ScriptArgs -AdditionalSources @(
    @{
        Name                = 'MySource'
        Source              = 'https://nexus.example.org/repository/MyChocolateySource/index.json'
        Credentials         = $MySourceCredential
        AllowSelfService    = $true
        AdminOnly           = $true
        BypassProxy         = $true
        Priority            = 10
        Certificate         = 'C:\cert.pfx'
        CertificatePassword = 's0mepa$$'
    }
)
```

Only the `Source` and `Credential` parts of the passed object are required, everything else is optional.

This can override the sources we create in the client setup.

#### Packages

You can install additional packages during the Client Setup script invocation.

```powershell
.\ClientSetup.ps1 @ScriptArgs -AdditionalPackages @(
    @{
        Id      = 'firefox'
        Version = '144.0.0'
        Pin     = $true
    }
)
```

Only the `Id` part of the passed object is required, everything else is optional.

If you find yourself wanting to perform more complex installations, e.g. using parameters, we would recommend adding them to the script itself.
