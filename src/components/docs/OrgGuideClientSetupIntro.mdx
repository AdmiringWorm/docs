With your Chocolatey for Business environment nearing completion, the final step is to configure your client endpoints for use with Chocolatey.

We have several ways to do this depending on which parts of the Organizational Deployment Guide you have configured.

To set up and configure your client endpoints, please select the tile to get started:

<div class="row mb-md-5">
    <div class="mb-4 mb-lg-0 col-sm-6 col-lg-4">
        <div class="card card-link card-overlay-bottom card-overlay-theme-bottom h-100 min-h-px-200" style="background-image:url('https://img.chocolatey.org/backgrounds/chocolatey-for-business.svg');">
            <div class="card-body d-flex flex-column z-1">
                <div class="mt-auto">
                    <Xref title="Client Setup" value="organizational-client-setup" classes="h4 mb-0 stretched-link" />
                </div>
            </div>
