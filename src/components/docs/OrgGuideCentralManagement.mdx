Chocolatey Central Management is made of of 4 components, installed via Chocolatey. Those components are:

- Chocolatey Management Database (chocolatey-management-database): This provides the database schema used by Chocolatey Central Management.
- Chocolatey Management Service (chocolatey-management-service): This is the service that handles processing requests from agents running in your environment.
- Chocolatey Management Website (chocolatey-management-web): This is the web interface for Chocolatey Central Management.
- Chocolatey Agent Service (chocolatey-agent): This is the service that runs on an endpoint that facilitates reporting and deployment activities from Chocolatey Central Management.

## Planning Your Installation

Chocolatey Central Management can be installed on a single server or each component can be installed on separate servers. **All three components are required for a Chocolatey Central Management installation.**

If you have Chocolatey for Business licenses for more than 1,000 endpoints, we recommended installing the components on separate servers.
For 1,000 licenses or fewer, you can install all components on a single server, though we still recommend using a licensed version of SQL Server for the database component.

# Before You Begin

Before you can install the Chocolatey Central Management Database, you need to have a SQL Server Instance available. SQL Server Express is only recommended for testing and small environments (fewer than 1,000 endpoints). If you need help installing and configuring SQL Server Express, <Xref title="please see our documentation here" value="setup-sql-server-express-organizational-deployment-guide" />.

## Available Parameters

- `Component`: The component to install. Valid values: `Database`, `Web`, `Service`, `All`
- `ServiceCredential`: The credentials to use with the Chocolatey Management Service. If the account does not exist, it will be created. (Service and Web components only)
- `ConnectionString`: The connection string to use to connect to the database.
- `LicenseFile`: The path to the Chocolatey for Business license file. If not provided, you will br prompted to browse for it.
- `IsOffline`: If true, you will be required to provide the path to the zip file containing the internalized Chocolatey components required for installation.
- `OfflineInstallationMedia`: The path to the zip file containing the internalized Chocolatey components required for installation. This is only required if `IsOffline` is true.
- `CertificateThumbprint`: The thumbprint of the certificate to use for the Chocolatey Management Service. (Service and Web components only)
- `CertificateDnsName`: The DNS name to use for the Chocolatey Management Service if using a wildcard certificate. (Service and Web components only)

## Securing Chocolatey Central Management Communications

By default, the install will create and use self-signed certificates for the Chocolatey Management Service and Web components.
If you wish to use your own certificates, you can do so by providing the `CertificateThumbprint` and `CertificateDnsName` parameters.
