## Issue

In an automation script (`.ps1`/`.psm1`) the scripts make use of either reading or writing private environment variables that should only be used by Chocolatey CLI helpers and not the automation scripts themselves.

## Recommended Solution

Remove any use of the following environment variables in the automation scripts.

- `chocolateyToolsLocation`
- `chocolateyBinRoot`
- `chocolatey_bin_root`
- `chocolateyPackageFolder`
- `packageFolder`
- `chocolateyChecksum32`
- `chocolateyChecksum64`
- `chocolateyChecksumType32`
- `chocolateyChecksumType64` 
- `downloadCacheAvailable`

## Reasoning

The variables are used by the Chocolatey CLI helpers by including additional support and should not be used by the automation scripts themselves.
