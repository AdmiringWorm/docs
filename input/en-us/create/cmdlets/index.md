# PowerShell Cmdlet Helpers Reference

See also: [PowerShell Functions Reference](xref:powershell-reference)

## Summary

In your Chocolatey packaging, you have the ability to use these commands (and others with Chocolatey's [PowerShell Extensions](xref:extensions)) to work with all aspects of software management.
Keep in mind Chocolatey's automation scripts are just PowerShell, so you can do anything you want.

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> These commands are for package scripts, not for use directly in PowerShell. This is in the create packages section, not the using Chocolatey section.
